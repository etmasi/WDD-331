        <hr>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            At the beginning of the semester you were asked to install several
            utilities in fact, many of which we haven't discussed yet. Lets do
            that now. You have been learning about organization and debugging
            this week through your readings, lets take a few minutes and explore
            those tools to see how they might help with those goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will put us back at the command line typing in commands...you
            may need to review the
            <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/cmd-line-mac.html" target="_blank" style="outline: none;">command line mac</a>
            or
            <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/cmd-line-pc.html" target="_blank" style="outline: none;">command line pc</a>
            resources. You will need to be comfortable changing directories to
            succeed with this activity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure to have
          <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-2nd-edition/read/2" target="_blank" style="outline: none;">CSS Master: Ch2. Debugging and Optimization</a>
          open to refer to during this activity. It has usage instructions for
          some of the utilities we will be looking at here.
        </p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Prepare</h3>
            <p>
              There is a bit more setup we need to do before we can start with
              Stylelint. Open a command prompt for your computer and run the
              following:
            </p>
            <!-- Remove this for next semester -->
            <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash"><span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> -g stylelint-config-standard</code></pre>
            <p>
              Then change to a directory where you have a .css file you would
              like to check. Create a file there called
              <kbd>.stylelintrc.json</kbd> Put the following inside that file:
            </p>
            <pre class=" language-json"><code class=" language-json">{
  "extends": "stylelint-config-standard"
}</code></pre>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Lint your code</h3>
            <p>
              Make sure you are still in the directory where created the
              <kdb>.stylelintrc.json</kdb> file (you may not see the file in the
              file manager, but if you do a <kbd>ls -la</kbd> on Mac or
              <kbd>dir</kbd> on Windows you should see it.) and follow the
              directions in CSS Mastery to run the <kbd>stylelint</kbd> utility
              on the file. How many errors did you have? Try outputting the
              errors to a file using this syntax:
            </p>
            <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">stylelint stylesheet.css <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> csslintoutput.txt</code></pre>
            <p>
              Practice interpreting the error messages by fixing them until the
              test comes back clean.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                Linters have become quite popular not just with CSS, but also
                HTML and Javascript. One thing to understand however is that
                they are
                <strong>not</strong> validators. They will find some errors, but
                they are more concerned with helping you write clean optimized,
                readable code. They tend to be very opinionated as a result.
                They don't just encourage you to write valid code, but
                <em>correct</em> code by avoiding bad practices...according to
                whomever setup the rules of the Linter.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may or may not agree with all these opinions however, and so
                most Linting packages are configurable...you can use your own
                opinions instead of someone else's. Instructions on how to
                modify Stylelints defaults can be found at
                <a href="https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/master/docs/user-guide/get-started.md" target="_blank" style="outline: none;">Stylelint docs</a>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Analyze-Css</h3>
            <p>
              The next tool we will use is Analyze-Css. With the same CSS file
              as the last step run the analyze-css utility. "How?" you may be
              asking..."that tool wasn't in the reading and I've never seen it
              before!" Read on...
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                Try running each of these utilities without any arguments...just
                type the command. You should see some hints on how to use the
                command. This is pretty typical for these type of utilities and
                learning how to read this type of concise help is a good skill
                to develop.
              </p>
              <p>
                if you run it for analyze-css for example you will see something
                like this:
              </p>
              <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">
    analyze-css --url <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>url<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>options<span class="token punctuation">]</span>
    
    Options:
      --url                Set URL of CSS to analyze                                            
      --file               Set <span class="token builtin class-name">local</span> CSS <span class="token function">file</span> to analyze                                        
      --ignore-ssl-errors  Ignores SSL errors, such as expired or self-signed certificate errors
      --pretty, -p         Causes JSON with the results to be pretty-printed                    
      --no-offenders, -N   Show only the metrics without the offenders part                     
      --auth-user          Sets the user name used <span class="token keyword">for</span> HTTP authentication                      
      --auth-pass          Sets the password used <span class="token keyword">for</span> HTTP authentication                       
      --version, -V        Show version number and quit                                         
      --help, -h           This <span class="token builtin class-name">help</span> text           
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                There are certain conventions that are almost always followed
                with these helps. Here are a few of the more common conventions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Things written in ALLCAPS or in <strong>bold</strong> often
                  means type it <em>exactly</em> as it appears,
                </li>
                <li>
                  and lowercase, <em>italics</em>, or surrounded with &lt; &gt;
                  can mean you are supposed to change it to something specific.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Something surrounded in [ ] is going to be an optional part of
                  the command. It will work with our without that part.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A | (pipe) between two parameters means that you can use one
                  or the other, but not both.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We want to run the tool against a local file instead of a
                URL...and I see an option for that above. Something like this
                should work:
              </p>
              <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">analyze-css --file filename.css</code></pre>
              <p>
                The results are not very readable however. How would you modify
                the command to give better output?
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Most of what Analyze-css gives back is informational. It tells you
              how many selectors you are using, how specific they are (less
              specific is usually better), if you are using any prefixed css
              that you don't need to anymore, and then it will point out
              offenders and duplicates...selectors that you really should look
              at and optimize.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Uncss</h3>
            <p>
              Finally run the uncss utility on your file. It is a great
              optimization tool. It looks at your css and finds any rules that
              were not used...then removes them! Try this for example. Take a
              look at the CSS for the
              <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation.css" target="_blank" style="outline: none;">Foundation css framework</a>. Then take a look at this simple
              <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation-all.html" target="_blank" style="outline: none;">example page</a>
              that has the Foundation css linked in. Now run Uncss on it.
            </p>
            <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">uncss http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation-all.html</code></pre>
            You may even want to send the results to a file like this:
            <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">uncss http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation-all.html <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> optimized.css</code></pre>
            <p>What was the result?</p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Submit</h3>
            <p>
              Submit your output file of errors from CSSLint in step 1, and the
              optimzed css file you got from step 3 to ILearn.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>File of errors from StyleLint uploaded. 5pts</li>
          <li>Optimized file from Uncss uploaded. 5pts</li>
